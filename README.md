# 🚀 50Days25DevChallenges

Welcome to my personal dev sprint: **#50Days25DevChallenges**  
A challenge to learn, build, and master **25 different developer tools, libraries, frameworks, or technologies** in just **50 days**.

---

## 🎯 Mission

To **level up my development skillset** by exploring modern and in-demand technologies — one tool every 2 days.  
Each mini challenge focuses on **learning + hands-on implementation**, resulting in documented code and insights.

---

## 📚 What to Expect

For each tool or technology, you'll find:
- ✅ A clear goal of what I’m learning
- 🧠 Key concepts or notes
- 💻 Code examples and practical use
- 📁 Separate folders per challenge
- 📅 Daily progress log

---

## 🛠️ Why This Challenge?

As a developer, I realized that learning tools in isolation is not enough.  
So I created this structured, time-bound series to:
- Break comfort zones
- Sharpen practical understanding
- Build better & faster
- Create a public log of growth
